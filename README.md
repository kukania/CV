## Research Interests

My research interest is optimizing storage systems especially data indexing. I have implemented various flash translate layer (FTL) algorithms that
are related to indexing logical address to physical address in NAND flash storage. Also, I am studying one of the most popular algorithms for key‑
value stores log‑structured merge tree (LSM‑tree), and I suggested several techniques of LSM‑tree when LSM‑tree is used for a resource‑limited
environment like an embedded system.
